In this code, we will predict the Blood Pressure using Machine Learning Algorithm

we are using Linear Regression for forecasting the High Blood

we are using Data set of blood pressure who available on Kaggle.

we are trained 80Per data and test 20Per data

accuracy of the model score is 60 percent this is not bad for initial testing, how actually the work.
